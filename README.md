# Dell Power Manager
Cross-Platform Dell Power Manager re-implementation in Flutter. More screenshots in [Wiki](https://github.com/alexVinarskis/dell-powermanager/wiki).

![Screenshot Summary](images/screenshot_summary.png)

## Why
Dell machines (XPS and Precision series laptops, potentially others) offer advanced in-bios configurable options, such as multiple thermal profiles, battery charging thresholds, etc. It may be very desirable to adjust these on the go, and there is no way to configure it from OS without Dell's proprietary tools (which are luckily provided). Settings can be changed via:
* BIOS directly, requires reboot
* [Dell Command | Configure](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000178000/dell-command-configure) CLI, available for both Windows and Linux, with impressive [list of capabilities](https://dl.dell.com/topicspdf/command-configure_reference-guide4_en-us.pdf).
* [Dell Power Manager](https://www.dell.com/support/contents/en-au/article/product-support/self-support-knowledgebase/software-and-downloads/dell-power-manager) GUI, available for Windows only. On top of that, it is ridiculously slow to start, and (subjectively) ugly.

This app is a modern, Flutter based GUI on top of Dell Command | Configure CLI, with main goal to replicate behavior of Dell Power Manager for Linux users, but also does run on Windows.

## Features
* Implements control via 'Dell Command | Configure CLI' (CCTK)
* Modern animated UI, supports Dark Mode
* Short startup time, much faster than Dell's Windows app
* Detects and handles unsupported modes on supported machines
* Detects non-dell machines, shows error message
* Support protected BIOS (System/Setup/Owner passwords), and secure key saving

For Debian/Ubuntu based Linux and Windows, app is slightly more productized:
* Integrated dependencies downloader and installer
* Packaged to `.deb`/`.msi`, with start menu shortcuts etc.
* Integrated OTA via Github API

Control features:
* Battery status overview (health etc.)
* Battery charging control (w/o advanced/daily timing mode for now)
* Thermal profiles control
* Detects OS's power mode

Planned TODOs:
* Advanced battery charging control/shceduling ([Feature Request](https://github.com/alexVinarskis/dell-powermanager/issues/24))
* "Peak Shift" control ([Feature Request](https://github.com/alexVinarskis/dell-powermanager/issues/57))

Potential future features to consider:
* Add monitoring service for auto switching thermal profiles based on CPU load
* Add monitoring service for auto switching thermal profiles based on power settings, eg. Battery level, plug/unplugged etc.

## Development status
Application is currently in **stable, maintained** state.

* Dell's CCTK integrated (with automated installer for select OSs)
* Update checks implemented (with OTA ia Github API for select OSs)
* UI tested, build and packaging asserted by CI
* Packaged to `.msi`, `.deb`, `.tar.xz`. Get latest stable build at [Releases](https://github.com/alexVinarskis/dell-powermanager/releases/latest), or latest development build at [CI artifacts](https://github.com/alexVinarskis/dell-powermanager/actions/workflows/build.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)
* Tested on multiple platforms, see [Compatibility](#compatibility). Supported on:
    * Windows, x86_64 (Native `.msi`)
    * Windows, arm64 (x64_86 `.msi` running in emulation)
    * Linux, x86_64 (Native `.deb`, `.tar`)
    * Linux, arm64* (Native `.deb`, `.tar`) _Only battery info part is working - not actual control as CCTK from Dell are not available for arm64 (yet?)_
## Build from source
### Linux
* Install dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get install -y ninja-build libgtk-3-dev libsqlite3-dev libsecret-1-0 libsecret-1-dev
```
* Run from source via `flutter run`, build via `flutter build linux --release`
* Package to `.deb`, `.tar.xz` via `./package.sh`

ATTENTION: do _not_ install flutter from `snap`, you native [installation instead](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux/desktop) - snap-provided flutter will fail to compile for this project due to [snap specific issues](https://github.com/juliansteenbakker/flutter_secure_storage/issues/676).

### Windows
* Run from source via `flutter run`, build via `flutter build windows --release`
* Package to `.msi` via `.\package.bat`

## Contributing

### Debugging

By default, all logging is supressed. Export `POWERMANAGER_DEBUG=true` before running app from CLI to get logs.
Eg.: `export POWERMANAGER_DEBUG=true && ./dell-powermanager > file.log`. When opening an issue, kindly save and attach the log.

### Translations
App supports multiple languages via Flutter's localization library. If you want to contribute:
* Check out [lib/l10n/*.arb](lib/l10n/app_en.arb) files.
* Create similar file for you language, translate the strings.
* Open PR with your changes.
